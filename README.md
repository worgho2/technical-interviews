# Technical Interviews

This repository contains a range of technical interview challenges and practical exercises that I've worked through. It's a blend of classic coding problems and real-world software engineering scenarios, including:

## ðŸ”§ Core Topics Covered

- **Backend Engineering** â€“ RESTful APIs, microservices, and server-side logic.
- **Frontend Tasks** â€“ UI components, interaction logic, and performance patterns.
- **CI/CD Pipelines** â€“ Automation scripts, GitHub Actions, and deployment workflows.
- **Design & Structural Patterns** â€“ MVC, Hexagonal Architecture and much more.
- **Clean Code & Best Practices** â€“ Maintainable, readable, and testable code.

Each solution is structured for clarity, with clean, _sometimes_ well-documented code and occasional notes or explanations.
